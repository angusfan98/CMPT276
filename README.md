1. FantasySports is an online web application which allows a group of users to play a fantasy sports game online. Users create their own accounts, login/logout and will be able to join/create a new fantasy league. (Can send out a link for other users to join).  We will have an interactive menu that allows users to see their current players, stats, rankings, allow users to interact with each other such as proposing trades. Users are also able to see projected stats each week for their players and the league creator (admin) can change the scoring system for the league to their own desire/ veto trades. This web application is intended to be an interactive game which uses databases to keep track of stats. 

2. SHARE: This website/interface allows users to neatly organize their links and files from other websites in a clear manner. Users will be able to click on these links, drag files around, edit files and upload/download files and links; users will be able to create their own accounts and login/logout. The user will be able to search and favourite specific items directly from the website and open in another tab. The main purpose of SHARE is to provide users with a unified interface for projects/files/links so that the user does not need to jump back and forth searching through multiple websites. SHARE is not a cloud file storage service, rather it links websites like Dropbox and Google Drive together to assist the user in organization. This website/interface is intended to easily share and organize projects/files links.

3. Visual Reminder is a website where the user can create a canvas to upload images through either a URL or an image on their device which can be dragged, resized and cropped. As well, the canvas and the images associated can be given a title/caption and be renamed. Users can create their own accounts and login/logout, and each account can have multiple personal canvas boards. The main purpose is to help visual thinkers plan in a visual way using images. The website will include image hyperlinks, undo buttons, reminders, dates, and times to easily organize these images. This can be used to plan out projects such as building a computer, planning a room layout or hosting a dinner party. Canvas boards can be shared with others and the user can give permission to others to edit, view or comment on these canvases.
